Blog back-end built during the bootcamp of Generation Brazil, using Spring, and deployed with Heroku. It has been tested with JUnit and Postman.
The documentation was done with Swagger and can be accessed [here](https://springbackendblog.herokuapp.com/) (user: root, password: root).

It is connected with a Angular application also developed during the bootcamp, whose repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mthsps/blog-frontend-generation/).

### Possibile improvements
The blog was built for learning purposes and therefore can be improved with more time to increase security, implement sessions or cookies, and handle all sorts of exceptions to business rules.
